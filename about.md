# About Me

I’m **Karthik**, a Quality Engineering Manager with 19 years of experience driving test maturity 
improvement initiatives across data engineering projects. I’ve worked extensively with cloud data 
warehouses like **Snowflake** and **Azure SQL**, and I’m passionate about implementing 
automation-first approaches to streamline data testing.

I’m currently enrolled in the **Master of Science in Data Science** program at **Southern Methodist University** (2024-2026). 
I love exploring new technologies, especially around **machine learning** and **generative AI** for 
efficiency gains. When I'm not busy debugging or analyzing data, you’ll find me experimenting with 
new coffee blends (because a good coffee is a data scientist’s best friend, right?).

Feel free to check out my [CV](/cv) to see more details about my professional journey.
